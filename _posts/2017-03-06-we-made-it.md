We are pleased to announce that Google has selected Clojure as a mentoring organisation for this year's summer of code!
This means that Google will sponsor students from around the world to work on projects that are part of the Clojure ecosystem.
Now that we know that Clojure will be participating, what happens next?

### Getting involved

The student application period will be open from the 20th of March through the 3rd of April.
In the meantime, there are a number of ways to get involved:

#### Mentors

If you maintain an open source Clojure(Script) project and would like to grow it, you should consider becoming a mentor.
You can find out more about what being a mentor is about out on the [mentors page](/mentors/).

#### Students

While it is still to early to formally apply as GSoC student, this is a great time to start thinking about project ideas and reach out to potential mentors.
Check out the [students page](/students/) for more information on how to apply successfully.

#### Everyone else

Even if you can’t participate as student or don’t want to be a mentor, you can still help by letting people know about GSoC at your local Clojure meetup, university, or other local group.
