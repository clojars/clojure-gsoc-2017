### Short description

*180 characters*

Clojure is a dynamic and functional general-purpose programming language that primarily targets the Java Virtual Machine and JavaScript.

### Long description

*2000 characters*

Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), JavaScript, and Microsoft’s .NET framework.
It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system.
Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.
When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.

Clojure, as a GSoC mentoring organization, includes projects from all parts of the Clojure ecosystem, from IDE tooling to logic programming libraries.


## Proposals

> Guidance for students on how to apply to your organization.
> Should include any prerequisites or requirements.
> You may wish to include a template or tips for their proposals.
> May include limited Markdown.
>
> Enter tags that students can select (one) from and apply to their own proposals to help organize them.
> Examples: New Feature, Optimization. You can also use these to designate “sub-organizations” if you are an umbrella organization.
